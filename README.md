## NPM Modules with Private Repos

In order to deploy private repos as modules through npm, an oauth token needs to be passed in the git repo URL for the `physical-telegram-stickers-models` module. It's only possible for an oauth token to be tied to a personal account on Github, so if a new token needs to be generated, generate one by following the instructions [here](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line/).
